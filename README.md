Automated python code to extract tweets using snscrape


In this project I was helping a friend for her PhD thesis which required different queries of tweets from Twitter. The tweets had to fall in different categories, from different gorups of twitter handels and include certain keywords.

Instead of extracting these tweets manually, I wrote an automated python module to extract the tweets with all the required information and also generate a report to show the relevancy and quality of inputs.
